Concepts of git:-

- keeps track of code history
- takes "snapshots" of the files
- decide when to take a snapshot by making a "commit"
- visit any snapshot any time
- stage files before committing 

Basic commands:-

$ git init : will initialize local git repository. It will create a .git folder in the project that will stay hidden.

$ git add <file> : adds file(s) to the staging area or the index.

$ git status : to see what we have in the staging area and ready for commit. This will display differences between the working tree.

$ git commit : when ready we can commit the file(s). This will take everything in the index and put it into the local repository

Remote repository commands:-

$ git push : transfer local branch commits to the remote repository branch (such as Github)

$ git pull : fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch. Downloading latest changes from the remote repository. 

$ git clone : retrieve an entire repository from a hosted location via URL. This will copy a remote repository into the current folder.
